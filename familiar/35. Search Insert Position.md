# Question body
```
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Use binary search to conform question request time complexity O(logN)

1. Loop array with binary search. The search will end at `nums[x] and nums[x + 1]`
2. There are three comparision result after loop:
	1. `target > nums[x]`: target should be put at `x + 1` position
	2. `target < nums[x]`: target should be put at `x` position
	3. `target == nums[x]`: target should be `x` position
