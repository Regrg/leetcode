# Question body
```
Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Loop string twice, Get final length and assign value into the result string

1. Create a function to calculate result string and return the length of the string
2. First, get the length of the string and malloc
3. Second, pass the malloced string into the function and assign value into the string

### Tip 2
#### Make longer string as base string, add the result into base string. And memmove if necessary

1. Choose the longer string as base string, add shorter string into the base string
2. If the final carry after calculation is 1, `memmove` the whole string one position to the right and add 1 at the left-most position
