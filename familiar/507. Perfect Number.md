# Question body
```
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.

Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### The max divisor of a number N is sqrt(N), loop from 1 to sqrt(N) and add all the factors

1. Loop from 1 to sqrt(N)
2. Add up all the divisors and dividends along the way


*Remember to avoid the number N itself(dividend of 1) and square root(both divisor and dividend of square root are the same)*
