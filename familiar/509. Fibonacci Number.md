# Question body
```
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Use `recursive` function to calculate the nth fibonacci number

1. Return directly if n == 0 or n == 1
2. Recursively call function itself to get func(n - 1) + func(n - 2)

### Tip 2
#### Use `iteration` to calculate the nth fibonacci number

1. Return directly if n == 0 or n == 1
2. Store the 0th and 1th number and alternately replace with new number until reach nth number
