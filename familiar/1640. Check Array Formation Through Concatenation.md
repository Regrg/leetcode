# Question body
```
You are given an array of distinct integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces, where the integers in pieces are distinct. Your goal is to form arr by concatenating the arrays in pieces in any order. However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array pieces[i].

Return true if it is possible to form the array arr from pieces. Otherwise, return false.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Loop `pieces` 2D-array, compare with `arr` array until `arr` array ends

1. Loop `pieces` 2D-array. When the first number is equal to `arr` array, compare the rest of numbers behind `pieces[i]`
2. Get true when all numbers in `arr` array are equal during the loop of `pieces` 2D-array
3. Get false when no first number in `pieces` 2D-array is equal to `arr` array or a number in `pieces[i]` is not equal to `arr` array

### Tip 2 `extend tip 1`
#### Use hashmap to reduce the look up time of `pieces` 2D-array

1. Traverse `pieces` 2D-array, and use the first number of each `piece` as key and whole array of `pieces[i]` as value
2. Loop `arr` array, and look up number in the hashmap
3. Get true when all numbers in `arr` array are equal to all `pieces[i]` in hashmap
4. Get false when no number found in hashmap or a number in `pieces[i]` is not equal to `arr` array
