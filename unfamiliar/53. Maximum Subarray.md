# Question body
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Use dynamic programming, record sum and maximum along the loop behavior
1. If currenet `sum` is negative, go to the next number
	1. Because a negative sum can NEVER be greater after adding any number
		1. `negative sum` + `positive number` = `positive sum smaller than positive number` (which is smaller than `positive number`)
		2. `negative sum` + `negative number` = `negative sum smaller than negative number` (which is smaller than `negative number`)

### Tip 2
#### Use divide and conquer, recursively find maximum of three sums

1. Recurrsively divide array into two parts
2. Find maximum sum of left part
3. Find maximum sum of right part
4. From the middle element, find `the maximum sum of left part`, and `the maximum sum of right part`. Then add the up
	1. ex: [1, -3, 4, -1, 2], the middle element is `4`
		1. Left parts along the loop are: -3, -3+1, the sums are all negative, so the maximum sum is 0
		2. Right parts along the loop are: 4, 4-1, 4-1+2, the maximum sum is 4-1+2=5
5. Recurrsively compare the results of `step 2`, `step 3`, and `step 4`
