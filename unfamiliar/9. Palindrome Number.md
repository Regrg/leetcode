# Question body
```
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Reverse original number and compare

1. Looply divide original number to get digit-reversed number
2. Compare two numbers
> The reversed number might overflow(ex: 2147483647). Need to use larger type to accomedate it

### Tip 2
#### Convert integer to string, and compare digit in char array

1. Use build-in function(ex: sprintf) to cover integer to string
2. Looply compare digit 0 <-> len-1, 1 <-> len-2, ..., len/2-1 <-> len/2+1

### Tip 3 `extend Tip 1`
#### Reverse original number until digit-reversed number is bigger than divided-original number
> definition: digit-reversed number and divided-original number are:

> Ex: original number is 123</br>
> The first round:</br>
> divided-original number is 12, digit-reversed number: 3</br>
> The second round:</br>
> divided-original number is 1, digit-reversed number: 32
> The third round:</br>
> divided-original number is 0, digit-reversed number: 321

`Digit-reversed number should be equal to divided-original nubmer at the position of len/2 if it is a palindrome number`
1. Looply divide original number and put reversed digit into reversed number
2. Looply compare divided-original number and digit-reversed number. It they are equal during to process, original number is palindrome
3. If digit-reversed number is larger than the divided-original number, but they never be equal, the number is not palindrome
