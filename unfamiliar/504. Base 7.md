# Question body
```
Given an integer num, return a string of its base 7 representation.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Use [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division). Dynamically maintain the result string.
1. Record negative if the number is negative number
1. Convert the number to absolute value
1. Recursively divide the number by 7 until quotient becomes zero, remember the remainder and replace the number with quotient
1. Add minus sign if the original number is negative number
1. Reverse the remainders of the calculation

### Tip 2 (Extend `Tip 1`)
#### Dynamically maintain the result buffer is expensive. Loop the division twice to remove dynamically maintaining.
1. Record negative if the number is negative number
1. Convert the number to absolute value
1. Recursively divide the number by 7 until quotient becomes zero. Return the dight length of the result
1. Recursively divide the number by 7 until quotient becomes zero. Put the remainder from (digit length - 1) ~ 0, *or 1 if the number is negative number*
