# Question body
```
You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").
```

# Tips

### Tip 1
#### Because the score is unique, use score as index to make a hash map
1. Loop scores and make a hash map of `$Score:$Index`
2. Traverse hash map from MAX to MIN and assign string to result array

### Tip 2
#### Do normalization and sort scores along with an array of original index
1. Create an index array
2. Sort scores along with index array
3. Loop soreted index array and assign string to result array
