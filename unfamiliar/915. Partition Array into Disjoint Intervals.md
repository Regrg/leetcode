# Question body
```
Given an integer array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.

Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Brute force method, compare maximum value of left-side range and minimum value of right-side range

1. Write two functions to find maximum value and minimum value in a range
2. Loop array and compare maximum value of left-side range and maximum value of right-side range

### Tip 2 `Extend Tip 1`
#### Use buufer to record minimum value of right-side range

1. Because finding the minimum value of right-side range from index `1~(n-1)`, `2~(n-1)`, `3~(n-1)`, ..., `(n-2)~(n-1)` is time complexity O(n^2). Use buffer to reduce the time
2. Find the minium value of right-side range from index `(n-1)~(n-2)`, `(n-1)~(n-2)`, `(n-1)~(n-3)`, ..., `(n-1)~1`, and write result into a buffer. The time complexity can be O(n)
3. Loop array and compare the maximum value of left-side range and the minimum value in the buffer

### Tip 3
#### The number smaller than current maximum value must be in the left-side range

1. Loop array and remember `current traversed maximum value`
2. When seeing a number smaller than `current traversed maximum value`, mark the index as <u>separate index</u>. Because this number must be in the left-side range (This number must NOT conform the rule of `All right-side range numbers are bigger than all left-side range numbers`)
3. After traverse whole array, The <u>separate index + 1</u> will be the answer
