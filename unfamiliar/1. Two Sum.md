# Question body
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Traverse every two numbers possibility to reach the target number

1. Use nested loops to traverse array
2. Add up every two numbers and reach to the target number

### Tip 2
#### Use hash table to record previous numbers

1. Use one loop to traverse every number in the arry
2. Find the `target number - current number` in the hash table
3. If not found, add current number into hash table (key: number, value: index)
4. Continue `step 2` and `step 3` until find the number in the hash table
> Using hash table, thespace complexity is O(n), and time complexity is O(n)
