# Question body
```
There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Use brute force method, three loops to find number `i < j < k`

### Tip 2
#### Loop the number in the middle: `j`. Find numbers are less and larger than `j` on the left, and on the right

1. Loop the middle number: `j`
2. Loop the left side of `j`, and get number less and larger than `j`
3. Loop the right side of `j`, and get number less and larger than `j`
4. Add up (`number less than on the left` * `number larger than on the right` + `number larger than on the left` * `number less than on the right`) of all `j`
