# Question body
```
You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".
Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Brute force method. Try all possibilities with recursive

1. Use recursive method to add positive and negative of each number
2. When the sum is equal to `target`, add one to `count`

### Tip 2
#### Use 2D array `dynamic programming`

1. Create a 2D array with row of `numsSize` and column of `maximum sum - minimum sum`
2. Add and substract `nums[i]` and record the number at column of row `i`
3. Continue until the last row of 2D array. Get the `count` at row `numsSize - 1` and column `target`

### Tip 3
#### Continues to use dynamic programming. Derive original question to another question that only use 1D array

1. From original question, I got two equations:
	1. {number set A} + {number set B} = {Maximum sum}
	2. {number set A} + -1 * {number set B} = target
2. When `i` adds `ii`, I got `{number set A} = {Maximum sum} + target / 2`
3. Because **{Maximum sum} + target / 2** is a constant number in the question, the final equation in `step 2` means `finding all possible sums in set A which can get the number`
4. To solve the equation in `step 3`, I can use dynamic programming again by creating a 1D array which size is `{Maximum sum} + target / 2`
5. Looply add every number in the question and add 1 at the position of `i` in 1D array
6. After add all numbers, you can get the `count` at position `{Maximum sum} + target / 2` of the 1D array
