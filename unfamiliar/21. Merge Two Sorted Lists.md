# Question body
```
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.
```

# Tips
### Tip 1
#### Create a new single linked-list, and add elements in list1 and list2 in ascending order

1. Create a new single linked-list
2. Compare element in list1 and list2 one by one, and add smaller element into the new single linked-list accordingly
3. Until either list1 or list2 is empty, append the other list to the new single linked-list

### Tip 2
#### Make list1 as a base-list. Insert elements in list2 into list1

1. Find the elements in list2 which are smaller than `the first element of list1`. Insert in front of the first element of list1
2. Compare element in list2 to list1, and find the position that is smaller than **A** element of list1, but larger than **B** element of list1. Insert it between the **A** and **B** element of list1
3. The elements of list2 left after `step 1` and `step 2` are elements larger than `the last element of list1`. Append them behind the last element of list1
