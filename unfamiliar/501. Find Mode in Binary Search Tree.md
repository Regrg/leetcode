# Question body
```
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
```

# Tips

### Tip 1
#### Because there is a range of the numbers, directly use a bit array as hash-table.

1. Traverse BST in any order
2. Record value occurrence in the hash-table
3. Traverse hash-table to get maximum number of occurrences
4. Traverse hash-table to get values of maximum number of occurrences

### Tip 2
#### Travers BST in in-order can get an ascending-order sequence, record values with the max number of occurrences dynamically.

1. Traverse BST in in-order
2. Record max number of occurrences, current number of occurrences, current value, and dynamically maintain an array recording max number of occurrences values

### Tip 3 (Extend `Tip 2`)
#### Dynamically maintain values with the max number of occurrences is expensive. Traverse BST twice to remove dynamically maintaining.
1. Traverse BST in in-order. Get the max number of occurrences, and the count of values
2. Traverse BST in in-order. Put values with the max number of occurrences into the array
> Time complexity becomes 2 * O(n), but space complexity is O(1)
